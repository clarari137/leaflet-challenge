# leaflet-challenge

## Sources
For this homework assignment, I used the following outside sources in addition to the in-class activities. 
- I found the center of my map on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_center_of_the_United_States).
- For the markers and the popups, I used the [Leaflet Documentation](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html#marker).
- I used [this website](https://colordesigner.io/gradient-generator) to find my RGB codes for the color scale.
- I struggled most with the legend, and ended up relying on code from these two websites (https://codepen.io/haakseth/pen/KQbjdO, http://www.java2s.com/example/javascript/leaflet/leaflet-legend-showing.html), and combining that with our Choropleth example.
